This is a demonstration code sample to use the Potentiometer to swap autonomous routines - between competition mode autonomous (15 sec) and Programming Skill (60 sec).

The smaple has a two settign selector, but can be modified to select other autonomous routines by creating additional regions of the potentiometer settings (range)
